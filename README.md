# Active Record Introduction

Now that we've covered object relationships and ORMs, we will introduce Active
Record. Active Record is an ORM â€” it does the same sort of tasks we learned
about previously with ORMs. Using Active Record, just like using an ORM, can
make fetching and representing data easier. Using Active Record saves us the
trouble of writing our own custom ORMs.

Active Record gives us a few features. In this section we will discuss:

- The Active Record conventions and why programmers use them
- Active Record query methods
- Using Active Record to create a table

In the next several lessons, we'll learn how to build tables with Active Record,
which enables us to interact with a database to retrieve properties and
relationships of the objects in an application without writing SQL statements.
